Instead of assigning all devices in a large organization a single, massive network range, subnetting allows network administrators to create smaller, organized network segments.</p> <p>These smaller networks help improve network efficiency, enhance security, and optimize IP address usage. By segmenting a network, administrators can control traffic flow and isolate different departments, locations, or functional areas. Subnetting is particularly essential with IPv4 addresses, where address space is limited.</p> <p>In subnetting, each subnet is identified by a unique subnet mask, which defines how many addresses are available within that subnet. For example:</p> <ul> <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/24</code> subnet mask provides 256 IP addresses.</li> <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/27</code> subnet mask provides 32 IP addresses.</li> </ul> <p>The subnet size is determined by the number of devices that need IP addresses in each segment. In the sections below, we’ll visually break down how subnetting works and explore different subnet sizes.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/sn1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/sn2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/sn3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Visualizing Subnetting with the 10.0.0.x Range. To better understand how subnetting works, let’s look at the `10.0.0.x` IP address range. The images above illustrate different ways this range can be divided, showing the impact of using various subnet sizes. </div> </div> <h4 id="full-ip-range-10000-to-1000255">Full IP Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255</h4> <p>The <strong>first image</strong> shows the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.x</code> range, from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.0</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.255</code>, covering 256 IP addresses. This setup is often referred to as a <strong>/24 subnet</strong> (255.255.255.0), allocating 8 bits for host addresses. Here’s what each part represents:</p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.0</code> is the <strong>Network ID</strong>.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.255</code> is the <strong>Broadcast Address</strong>.</li> <li>IP addresses from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.254</code> are assignable to individual devices.</li> </ul> <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/24</code> subnet is ideal for medium-sized networks, allowing up to 254 devices in one segment.</p> <h4 id="highlighting-the-24-subnet">Highlighting the /24 Subnet</h4> <p>The <strong>second image</strong> explicitly marks this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.x</code> range as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/24</code> subnet, reinforcing the concept of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/24</code> network where the first three octets (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0</code>) represent the network portion, and the last octet is assigned to individual hosts.</p> <p>Using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/24</code> subnet mask ensures all addresses from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.0</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.255</code> remain in one network segment. This is useful when you want devices to communicate within the same network. However, if fewer devices are needed, dividing the network further can be more efficient.</p> <h4 id="splitting-into-25-subnets">Splitting into /25 Subnets</h4> <p>The <strong>third image</strong> splits the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.x</code> range into two <strong>/25 subnets</strong>, each with 128 addresses:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>first /25 subnet</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.0</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.127</code> <ul> <li>Network ID: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.0</code></li> <li>Broadcast Address: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.127</code></li> <li>Usable IP range: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.1</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.126</code></li> </ul> </li> <li>The <strong>second /25 subnet</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.128</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.255</code> <ul> <li>Network ID: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.128</code></li> <li>Broadcast Address: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.255</code></li> <li>Usable IP range: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.129</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.0.0.254</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/25</code> subnet has 126 usable IP addresses.

By converting IP addresses from decimal to binary, we can clearly visualize which bits represent the <strong>network</strong> and which represent the <strong>hosts</strong>. In this example, we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">203.0.113.0/27</code> subnet to illustrate this approach.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/sn6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In the binary representation:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Blue bits</strong> represent the <strong>network portion</strong> of the IP address.</li> <li><strong>Red bits</strong> represent the <strong>host portion</strong> of the IP address.</li> <li><strong>Purple bits</strong> represent the <strong>borrowed bits</strong> that extend the network portion, allowing us to create additional subnets.</li> </ul> <h4 id="breaking-down-the-example-2030113027">Breaking Down the Example: 203.0.113.0/27</h4> <p>In this example, the subnet <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">203.0.113.0/27</code> is represented in binary to show how the address is divided:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Network Portion</strong>: The first 27 bits (in blue and purple) represent the network portion of the IP address.

This paper explores each layer in detail, illustrates the flow of data through various network devices, explains how data is encapsulated at each layer, and compares the OSI model with the TCP/IP suite. The inclusion of diagrams provides visual representations to enhance understanding.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>In the rapidly evolving world of computer networks, understanding how data travels from one device to another is crucial. The OSI model serves as a foundational blueprint that guides this understanding by dividing the networking process into seven distinct layers. Each layer has specific responsibilities, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and efficiently across networks. This paper delves into the intricacies of the OSI model, incorporating visual aids to elucidate complex concepts.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-osi-model-explained">The OSI Model Explained</h2> <p>The OSI model comprises seven layers, each building upon the last to facilitate seamless communication:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> Manages the physical connection between devices, including cables, switches, and signal transmission.</li> <li><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> Ensures error-free data transfer between adjacent network nodes through error detection and correction.</li> <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> Handles data routing, forwarding, and addressing to enable data transmission between devices on different networks.</li> <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers, including flow control and error handling.</li> <li><strong>Session Layer (Layer 5):</strong> Manages and controls the connections between computers, establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions.</li> <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</strong> Translates data between the application layer and the network format, handling data encryption and decryption.</li> <li><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7):</strong> Closest to the end-user, this layer interacts with software applications to implement a communicating component.</li> </ol> <hr/> <h2 id="data-flow-through-network-devices">Data Flow Through Network Devices</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/OSI1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> This diagram illustrates the flow of data in a network, showcasing how information travels from a cloud-based service (the internet) through various network devices like routers and switches before reaching end-user devices, such as computers. It represents the practical application of the OSI model and the TCP/IP suite, highlighting the path data takes across different network layers and devices. </div> <p><em>This diagram illustrates how data flows from a cloud-based service through various network devices before reaching end-user devices.</em></p> <p>The journey includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cloud-Based Service (Internet):</strong> Data originates from services hosted on the internet.</li> <li><strong>Routers:</strong> Operate at the Network Layer (Layer 3), directing data packets based on IP addresses to their destination networks.</li> <li><strong>Switches:</strong> Function at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2), forwarding data frames within the same network segment using MAC addresses.</li> <li><strong>End-User Devices:</strong> Devices like computers or smartphones that receive the data for user interaction.</li> </ul> <p>The diagram demonstrates the practical application of the OSI model and the TCP/IP suite, highlighting how each layer and device plays a role in data transmission.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="data-encapsulation-and-protocol-data-units">Data Encapsulation and Protocol Data Units</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/OSI2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> This image breaks down how data is encapsulated as it travels through each layer of the OSI model. Starting as raw data, it gains headers at each layer to form different Protocol Data Units (PDUs): a "Segment" at Layer 4 (Transport), a "Packet" at Layer 3 (Network), and a "Frame" at Layer 2 (Data Link). By Layer 1 (Physical), data is transmitted as bits. This encapsulation process is essential for data to be properly managed and understood at each layer. </div> <p><em>This image breaks down how data is encapsulated as it travels through each layer of the OSI model.</em></p> <p>As data moves through the OSI layers, it undergoes encapsulation, where each layer adds its own header (and sometimes a trailer) to the data unit from the layer above:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Application, Presentation, Session Layers (Layers 7-5):</strong> Data starts as high-level information.</li> <li><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> Encapsulates data into <strong>Segments</strong>, adding headers containing source and destination port numbers.</li> <li><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> Segments become <strong>Packets</strong> with the addition of IP headers that include source and destination IP addresses.</li> <li><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> Packets are framed into <strong>Frames</strong> with headers and trailers containing MAC addresses and error-checking data.</li> <li><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> Frames are converted into a stream of <strong>Bits</strong> for transmission over the physical medium.</li> </ul> <p>This process ensures that each layer can properly interpret and handle the data it receives.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="comparing-osi-and-tcpip-models">Comparing OSI and TCP/IP Models</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/OSI3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> This comparative chart maps the seven-layer OSI model against the four-layer TCP/IP suite, showing how the layers align. The OSI model’s layers (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical) are condensed into four broader TCP/IP layers (Application, Transport, Internet, and Link). This mapping helps clarify the similarities and differences between the two models, with each layer handling specific tasks to ensure seamless data communication across networks. </div> <p><em>This comparative chart maps the seven-layer OSI model against the four-layer TCP/IP suite.</em></p> <p>The TCP/IP suite simplifies the OSI model’s seven layers into four:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Application Layer (TCP/IP):</strong> Merges the OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.</li> <li><strong>Transport Layer (TCP/IP):</strong> Corresponds directly with the OSI’s Transport Layer.</li> <li><strong>Internet Layer (TCP/IP):</strong> Aligns with the OSI’s Network Layer.</li> <li><strong>Link Layer (TCP/IP):</strong> Combines the OSI’s Data Link and Physical layers.</li> </ul> <p>This mapping clarifies the functions each model handles and underscores their interoperability. Understanding this alignment is essential for network professionals who work with both models.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="practical-application-of-the-osi-model">Practical Application of the OSI Model</h2> <p>The OSI model isn’t just theoretical; it has practical implications in real-world networking:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> By isolating issues to specific layers, network engineers can efficiently diagnose and fix problems.</li> <li><strong>Protocol Development:</strong> Helps in designing protocols that can interact seamlessly across different systems and devices.</li> <li><strong>Education:</strong> Provides a structured approach to teaching and understanding complex networking concepts.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The OSI model remains a cornerstone in the field of networking, offering a universal language to describe how data moves across a network.

The fundamental benefit of SSH is its robust security, which includes encryption to prevent sensitive data from being exposed to network traffic analysis.</p> \[\text{SSH Encryption Formula: } E_K(M) = C\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>(E_K) is the encryption function</li> <li>(M) is the plain message</li> <li>(C) is the ciphered message</li> <li>(K) is the secret key</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2 id="accessing-bandit-level-0">Accessing Bandit Level 0</h2> <p>The primary task in Bandit Level 0 is to connect to the Bandit game server using SSH. This introductory level is designed to teach the basics of making an SSH connection. Here’s how you can connect:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org <span class="nt">-p</span> 2220
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This command initiates an <em>SSH</em> connection to <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">bandit.labs.overthewire.org</a> on port 2220, logging in as the user <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bandit0</code>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="secure-shell-overview">Secure Shell Overview</h2> <p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a cornerstone of secure network operations, ensuring encrypted communications between devices. For in-depth technical details, refer to the original SSH RFCs, like RFC 4253, which outline the protocol’s architecture and operation mechanisms.</p> <p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol designed for secure communication over an unsecured network. It is widely used by network administrators to control web and other types of servers remotely. SSH provides a secure channel over an insecure network by using a client-server model, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. The protocol specifies how to encrypt the data being sent, ensuring that both the identity of the client and the integrity of the data are protected from unauthorized access or interception. Notably, SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary. This feature distinguishes SSH from other remote administration tools, such as Telnet, which transmit passwords in plaintext and are vulnerable to interception.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="key-components-of-ssh">Key Components of SSH</h2> <p>Understanding the fundamental components of Secure Shell (SSH) is essential for leveraging its capabilities effectively. This section delves into the key elements that constitute SSH and how they contribute to its robust security model.</p> <p>At its core, SSH relies on cryptographic principles to establish secure communication channels over potentially insecure networks. One of the primary components of SSH is its encryption mechanism, which ensures that data transmitted between the client and server remains confidential and tamper-proof. By encrypting data, SSH protects sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception by malicious actors.</p> <p>Another crucial aspect of SSH is its authentication framework, which provides a means of verifying the identities of both the client and the server. Unlike traditional methods like Telnet<d-footnote>Telnet was exploited by attackers intercepting and capturing plaintext passwords transmitted over the network In 2000s worm known as "Lion" targeted this vulnerability.</d-footnote>, which rely on plaintext passwords, SSH employs public-key cryptography for authentication. This method significantly enhances security by eliminating the risk of password interception and brute-force attacks.</p> <p>Furthermore, SSH operates within a client-server architecture, where the SSH client initiates a connection with the SSH server. This model facilitates remote administration and enables administrators to securely access and manage servers from remote locations.</p> <p>In addition to encryption and authentication, SSH also incorporates mechanisms for session multiplexing and port forwarding, enhancing its versatility and utility in various network environments. These features allow users to establish multiple secure connections over a single SSH session and securely tunnel traffic between different network endpoints.</p> <p>By integrating these key components, SSH establishes a robust framework for secure remote communication and administration, making it an indispensable tool for network administrators and IT professionals alike.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="generating-ssh-key-pair">Generating SSH Key Pair</h2> <p>To further your understanding of SSH, here’s an example of how to generate a public/private key pair, which is a critical part of SSH’s secure authentication process:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> rsa <span class="nt">-b</span> 4096 <span class="nt">-C</span> <span class="s2">"your_email@example.com"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This command generates a new RSA key pair, which enhances security by using a 4096-bit key size.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="harnessing-the-power-of-ssh-commands">Harnessing the Power of SSH Commands</h2> <p>SSH not only secures communications but also supports a range of commands that facilitate remote system management. Below are some common SSH commands and their uses:</p> <ul> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code></strong>: Connect to a remote host.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-copy-id</code></strong>: Install your public key in a remote machine’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authorized_keys</code>.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-add</code></strong>: Add private key identities to the authentication agent.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sftp</code></strong>: Secure file transfer program.</li> <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code></strong>: Secure copy (remote file copy program).</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>“SSH is pivotal in today’s digital security landscape, providing the backbone for secure remote operations.” — Jane Doe, Cybersecurity Expert</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="ssh-operations">SSH Operations</h2> <p>SSH offers a plethora of functionalities beyond secure communication.
