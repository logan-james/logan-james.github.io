I’m a dedicated Computer Science graduate with expertise in Cybersecurity, Security Analysis, and public safety operations. My passion lies in protecting organizations and national security through effective incident response, vulnerability assessment, and investigative operations. Whether securing systems from emerging cyber threats or ensuring compliance with public safety regulations, I’m driven by the goal of safeguarding individuals and institutions.

This blog serves as a platform to share my journey, insights, and practical experiences as I work toward building a career in either cybersecurity or enforcement, with a focus on defense and security at every level.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I find inspiration in the great outdoors. Hiking, camping, and exploring nature help me recharge and fuel my creativity, enhancing my problem-solving skills in both technical and law enforcement environments.

This space reflects my professional journey in cybersecurity and public safety, as well as my personal passion for exploration and continuous growth.
