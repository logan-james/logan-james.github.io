I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in IT security and network operations. Currently, I’m deepening my expertise by studying for the Security+ certification and exploring broader IT roles, including network administration as I prepare for the CCNA. I’m passionate about building secure systems, protecting against cyber threats, and contributing to the resilience of organizations.

This blog is a place where I share insights from my journey in IT, as I work to hone my skills in cybersecurity and networking. My focus is on practical solutions, continuous learning, and staying up-to-date with industry developments to be well-prepared for a dynamic and evolving field.

Outside of tech, I find balance and inspiration through outdoor activities like hiking and camping. These experiences help me recharge and approach challenges with a fresh perspective.

This blog reflects my commitment to growing in IT security and network operations, as well as my passion for exploration and lifelong learning.
