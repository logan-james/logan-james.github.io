Hello, I'm **Logan**—a Computer Science graduate with a deep passion for IT security and network operations. My journey into technology started in childhood and has been defined by a curiosity to understand how systems work. This curiosity eventually led me back to school, where I committed to mastering the intricacies of computer networks, cybersecurity, and automation.

Currently, I’m enhancing my expertise through certifications while continuously experimenting with tools like Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate complex networks. I’m also diving into automation, finding efficient ways to streamline redundant networking tasks. As I build my skill set, I’m focused on deepening my understanding of data flow, network security, and privacy. My long-term goal is to contribute to open-source privacy and security tools that strengthen digital resilience.

This site is where I document my journey in IT. Here, I share practical solutions, document my learning experiences, and explore the latest developments in cybersecurity and networking. I believe in the power of continuous learning and aim to support others on similar paths by sharing my insights and discoveries.

Beyond technology, I’m passionate about martial arts. Wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and my time training in Muay Thai in Thailand have taught me discipline, resilience, and the value of constant self-improvement—principles I bring to my professional life. Outside the gym, I find balance in hiking and camping, which help me recharge and bring a fresh perspective to problem-solving.

Thank you for visiting my site. I invite you to explore the content, engage with my blog, and join me as I navigate the dynamic world of technology. This space reflects my commitment to growth in IT security, network operations, and my passion for lifelong learning and exploration.
