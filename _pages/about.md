Iâ€™m a dedicated Computer Science graduate specializing in Cybersecurity and Security Analysis. My passion lies in protecting organizations from emerging threats through effective incident response, vulnerability assessment, and security monitoring. This blog serves as a platform to share my journey, insights, and practical experiences as I work toward building a career in cybersecurity and defense.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I find inspiration in the great outdoors. Hiking, camping, and exploring nature help me recharge and fuel my creativity, which in turn enhances my problem-solving skills.

This space is a reflection of both my professional journey in cybersecurity and my personal passion for exploration and continuous growth.
