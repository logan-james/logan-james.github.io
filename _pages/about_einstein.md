Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I'm a passionate ``Computer Science`` student with a keen interest in the ever-evolving field of Cyber Security. Through this blog, I aim to document my journey, share insights, and connect with like-minded individuals as I delve deeper into the world of cyber defense and security.

Beyond the digital world, I have a profound appreciation for the great outdoors. Whether it's hiking, camping, or simply exploring nature, I find these activities rejuvenate my spirit and inspire creativity. 

I hope to make this space a reflection of both my professional aspirations and personal passions.

**Thank you for visiting my blog!**
