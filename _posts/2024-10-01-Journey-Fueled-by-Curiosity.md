Hi, I'm Logan, a recent Computer Science graduate who’s passionate about technology, particularly in the areas of networks and cybersecurity. My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity about how things work. From the first time I wrote code and saw it run successfully, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into the world of technology.

What truly drives me is the opportunity to learn, to discover, and to keep improving. Every day brings something new to explore, and I'm always excited about the possibilities that come with each new challenge. I don’t have all the answers, but I believe in the power of asking questions and staying curious.

### Bridging Code and Connectivity

In my academic projects, I've worked extensively with Java, but I have a particular affinity for Python due to its simplicity and versatility. I'm eager to expand my skills in writing automation scripts and leveraging languages like Python, Bash, or PowerShell for networking tasks. This intersection of coding and networking fascinates me, and I'm continually exploring new ways to integrate the two.

Before diving into computer science, I gained valuable experience working in industrial environments as an electrician. This role ignited my interest in the technical aspects of SCADA and PLC systems, steering me back to school to explore the digital side of operations. Understanding how these systems work from the inside out has been a thrilling journey.

### Beyond the Screen

Outside of technology, I have a lifelong passion for martial arts, including wrestling and jiu-jitsu. These disciplines have taught me the importance of discipline, focus, and continuous learning—principles I carry into my professional life. I also find balance and inspiration in the outdoors. Hiking, camping, and spending time in nature help me clear my mind and approach problems with a fresh perspective.

### Looking Forward

As I continue my journey, I'm committed to deepening my understanding of networking fundamentals and cybersecurity. I'm particularly interested in how data moves and how to protect it. My goal is to contribute to open-source privacy and security tools, helping to build a safer digital world for everyone.

Thank you for stopping by. I'm excited about the possibilities ahead and look forward to sharing more of my journey as I explore the ever-changing landscape of technology.
