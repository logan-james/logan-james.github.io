Welcome to the OverTheWire Bandit series! In this walkthrough, we'll guide you through solving Level 0 and progressing to Level 1. Let's dive in! [OverTheWire - Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

## Level Goal

The goal of Bandit Level 0 is to find the password for Level 1, which is stored in a file named `readme` located in the home directory.

## Commands for this level

- [ls](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) list directory contents
- [cd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html) change the working directory
- [cat](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) concatenate files and print on the standard output
- [file](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html) determine file type
- [du](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/du.1.htmlu) estimate file space usage
- [find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) search for files in a directory hierarchy

## Connecting to Bandit0

First, let's connect to the Bandit Level 0 server using SSH. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
You will be prompted to enter the password for Level 0, which is also `bandit0`.

## Locating the Readme File

Once logged in, you'll find yourself in the home directory (`/home/bandit0`). Let's list the files in the directory using the `ls` command:

```bash
ls
```
You should see `readme`.

## Reading the readme file

To view the contents of the `readme` file, use the `cat` command.

```bash
cat readme
```
This will display the password for Level 1 on the terminal.

## SSH into Bandit1

Now you have the pw for Level 1, **ssh** into the next level.

```bash
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Enter the password you obtained from the `readme` file when prompted.
